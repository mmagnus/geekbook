<i>Motto: **Notes are like your code**.</i>

(geekbook3 since finally Geekbook uses Python 3)

G33KB00K3 - fun to read & fun to write -- ðŸ¤“ eXtreme eXtendable note taking system for nerds/geeks (including scientists!) (= beautiful html generator of your markdown-based notes)  docs: http://geekbook.rtfd.io

**THE LATEST**

[Geekbook Bookify]( https://github.com/mmagnus/geekbook/tree/master/plugins/bookify) - a plugin to process your notes into e-books

**MOTIVATION**

I started using MoinMoin for my personal notes in 2008, but something was missing... I started then playing with simple notes in Markdown written in my Emacs. The next step was to write a system to convert this notes into HTML. The system was drafted in GdaÅ„sk, at the PTBI conference (2012) when I decided to write a tool to process a folder with notes written in Markdown. I wanted to use my CSS style and then more, and more some unique features that I found very useful for myself. I think, at the moment, the project converged pretty much to tools like http://jekyllrb.com and https://www.mkdocs.org.

A neat way how to combine **Emacs/Atom/Sublime/iA Writer editor + Markdown Syntax + Git + Html engine** (bootstrap/python) to get the best notes-talking experience ever. Highly customizable with plugins written in Python. What's the most important, under the hood it's just a set of Markdown files.. you can do with them whatever you want, e.g. you can Pandoc (http://pandoc.org/epub.html) them to epub (that's origin of "book" part of the name).

@todo Compare to Evernote.

Similar projects: it's kind of like Sphinx for your documentation, or Mkdocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/).

Freatures:

- Index html based
- Sync them with Dropbox/iCloud/github
- Read from console, grep them
- Edit with almost any text editor, I'm using Emacs!
- Keep images separately, edit them in any external tool or edit them in batch
- Customize html templates
- You can sync notes in your system with notes kept at virtual machines (mounted via sshfs) or drives
- Super light!
- Pandoc markdown files to anything you want!
- Use 3rd party editors, if you wish, on your computer or on your phone.

I recommend to use **Emacs** (or VIM or other super-powerful editor) to:

- run git on your notes in your editor,
- grep them in the editor,
- make bookmarks to parts of your notes,
- copy-paste from your notes to your programs you're writing,
- use Google Translate (https://github.com/atykhonov/google-translate)
- ispell,
- outline mode,
- focuse mode.

Sync with **Github** to have your notes (full-text searchable) with you all the time (in a private repository):

# On your phone
On your phone: (in this case using Dropbox & Byword on my iPhone).

![](docs/imgs/notes_at_phone.png)

Or Draft (http://lifehacker.com/draft-is-a-clean-note-taking-app-with-markdown-support-844836670) for Android (not tested by me).

![](docs/imgs/iphone_search_byword.png)

Search on your Iphone to get to the note.

Update: Now I'm using iA Writer for iPhone (https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/ia-writer/id775737590?l=pl&mt=12). It has sync with iCloud (works with sync also images (!)) and Dropbox. Geekbook has a nice plugin to be able to work with iA Writer seamlessly. 

![](docs/imgs/ia_writer_iphone.PNG)

If you insert an image on your phone, the syntax for it will be iA Writer-like. However if Geekbook detects this syntax it converts it to markdown syntax for images (which works as well in iA Writer). 

![](docs/imgs/screen800x500-0.jpeg)

Moreover, you can use in Geekbook also syntax `/<file.md>` to join chapters into books.

There is also a nice app for Mac (https://ia.net/writer/).
