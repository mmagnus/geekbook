Geekbook is a book because it can actually make full books!

We're testing this rigth now, stay tuned.

We're using Pandoc to convert to pdf/epub/tex etc :-) Pandoc can produce output in the EPUB electronic book format.

This means that it’s now very easy to produce an electronic book! Read more http://pandoc.org/epub.html
