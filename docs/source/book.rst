========================================================

Geekbook is a book because it can actually make full books!

We're testing this right now, stay tuned.

We're using Pandoc to convert to pdf/epub/tex etc :-) Pandoc can produce output in the EPUB electronic book format. EPUB books can be viewed on iPads, Nooks, and other electronic book readers, including many smart phones. (They can also be converted to Kindle books using KindleGen.). This means that itâ€™s now very easy to produce an electronic book! Read more <http://pandoc.org/epub.html>
